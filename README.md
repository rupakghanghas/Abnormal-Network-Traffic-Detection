📖 Description

Cyber attacks are increasingly sophisticated, and traditional signature-based intrusion detection systems fall short when facing novel threats. This project tackles this challenge by using machine learning to classify network connections as normal or belonging to one of four attack types: DoS, Probe, R2L, and U2R.

The solution involves data cleaning, feature engineering, class imbalance handling, and the use of various anomaly detection and classification models.
⚙️ Working

The working pipeline includes:

    Loading the KDD’99 dataset

    Preprocessing:

        Handling nulls, duplicates, and irrelevant data

        Label mapping and balancing classes using SMOTE

    Feature Engineering:

        ANOVA, Chi-Square, Kruskal-Wallis tests

        WoE encoding, one-hot encoding

        Outlier detection using Isolation Forest and LOF

        VIF for multicollinearity reduction

        Dimensionality reduction using PCA

    Model Training:

        Trained classifiers like Random Forest, XGBoost, and Logistic Regression

    Evaluation:

        Accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score

        Confusion matrix and classification report

    Confusion Matrix

    ROC-AUC Curve

📈 Results
Model	Accuracy	F1-Score	Precision	Recall
Random Forest	98.7%	0.987	0.988	0.987
XGBoost	98.5%	0.985	0.986	0.985
Logistic Regression	94.2%	0.943	0.945	0.941

    Note: Results may vary slightly depending on train-test splits and random seed.

🔍 Future Work

    Integrate deep learning models (e.g., LSTM, Autoencoders)

    Deploy the model as a real-time monitoring tool using Flask/FastAPI

    Extend analysis to NSL-KDD, UNSW-NB15, or CIC-IDS2017

    Integrate active learning to continuously adapt to new threats
